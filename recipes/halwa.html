        <h2>Description</h2>
        <section class="description">
        <p>An easy Arabic dessert that combines the luxurious flavors of saffron, cardamom, and rose.</p>
        <p>Halwa is a dessert made of sugar, spices like cardamom and nuts like almond and pistachio. Ghee is added and flavorings like rose water, cardamom, saffron and nuts.</p>
        <p>Halwa has an interesting texture. It’s not solid like a candy but not liquid either. As the Halwa cools, it does become firmer but doesn’t completely harden. It’s easiest scooped up with a spoon but can also be held with the hands, though a bit gooey and sticky. Halwa is often served when greeting house guests.</p>

        <h2 class="ing">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="Ingredients">
            <li>1/2cup Corn Flour</li>
            <li>2cups Water</li>
            <li>1cup Caster Sugar</li>
            <li>1tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>1/4tsp Ground Cardamom</li>
            <li>2tbsp Rose Water</li>
            <li>1pinch Saffron Threads</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Mix  Corn Flour (1/2 cup)  in  Water (2 cups)  and keep aside. To a heavy bottomed pan, add 
                Caster Sugar (1 cup)  and caramelize. Reduce the flame and add the cornflour-mixed water. At first, you may notice that the caramelized sugar has become hard. You need not worry it will melt and become a smooth liquid as it gets heated.</li>
            <li>Do not stop stirring at any time. Once the mixture starts to thicken, add  Cashew Nuts (2 Tbsp) ,  Butter (1 Tbsp) ,  Ground Cardamom (1/4 tsp) ,  Rose Water (2 pinches) , and  Saffron Threads (1 pinch) . Let the mixture become thick and until starts to leave the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Now switch off the flame. You might feel that the halwa is not at all solidified, but as it gets cool it will thicken. This halwa is not the type of halwa to cut and serve in pieces. This halwa is eaten with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Let it <strong>Cool Completely</strong> serve with hot strong sugar-free coffee</li>
