        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kahwa is a fragrant, mild green tea prepared using whole spices, saffron and almonds. In Oman, kahwa is consumed on a regular basis and is always offered to visitors along with dates or other dried fruits. The flavor is weak and extremely sweet (as it is strained with cardamom grains and sugar), and it also has a fragrant smell. Although kahwa is an Arabic coffee, it is also popular in other cuisines, especially in Kashmiri cuisine.</p>
